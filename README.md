# Nixvim flake 


## Configuring

look into `config/default.nix`. If you want to add new things, follow the example within that file :)

## Testing your new configuration

To test this config simply run the following command

```
nix run .
```

## Treesitter issues
if you're dealing with a broken notification system, try running `:TSInstall` and `:TSUpdate` from within NeoVim.
